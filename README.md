# CloudFortress

CloudFortress is a cloud security visibility and analytics platform built to monitor risks, threats, and exposures across enterprise cloud environments.

I built the initial working prototype in a focused 6-hour coding sprint, developing the core backend engine and SOC dashboard to demonstrate unified security monitoring.

The team is now expanding the platform to make it commercially enterprise-ready by adding detailed cloud security rules and controls across AWS, GCP, and Azure — covering misconfigurations, identity risks, and exposure scenarios.

This ongoing work is transforming CloudFortress from a rapid prototype into a scalable multi-cloud security operations solution.
